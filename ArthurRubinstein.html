                    <p style="padding-bottom :0px ;text-align: justify; border-bottom: 0px solid #eee;"> Arthur Rubinstein was born on January 28, 1887 and died on December 20, 1982, was a world-renowned pianist known for his expressive and virtuosic performances. He was born in Łódź, Poland to a family of musicians, and began studying piano at a young age. At two years old, Arthur demonstrates that he has perfect pitch and a fascination for the piano By the age of six, he was already performing in public, and he made his debut with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra at the age of ten. He quickly gained a reputation as a prodigious talent, and went on to have a long and illustrious career.<br><br>
                      Rubinstein made his New York debut at Carnegie Hall in 1906, then toured the United States, Austria, Italy and Russia. According to his own testimony and that of his son in the film L'Amour de la vie (1969) by François Reichenbach, he was not well received in the United States. During World War I, Rubinstein remained in London. In 1916 and 1917 he made his first tours of Spain and South America where he was widely acclaimed. In 1934 the pianist, who said he had neglected his technique in his early years, relying instead on natural talent, retired from concert life for several months of intensive study and practice. After that he continued to do tours all over the world. During his career he was known to be a soloist but he was also an exceptional chamber musician.<br><br>
                      One of Rubinstein's most notable contributions to classical music was his championing of the music of Frédéric Chopin. At his death he was considered a chopinist. Rubinstein was a passionate advocate for Chopin's music, and his performances of works such as the "Ballade No. 1" and the "Fantaisie-Impromptu" are still considered among the finest interpretations of these pieces. He believed that Chopin was the greatest composer for the piano, and he dedicated much of his career to exploring and performing Chopin's music.<br><br>
                      Rubinstein continued to perform well into his later years, and his legacy as a pianist and a musical ambassador is still felt today. He was a tireless performer and advocate for classical music, and his recordings and performances continue to inspire and captivate audiences around the world. In addition to his musical achievements, Rubinstein was also known for his wit and charm, and he was a beloved figure in the world of classical music. <br><br>
