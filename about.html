            8. Tips from IR4: (Romain M.)
            During our research on Lodz and Poland in general, we had the idea to contact two IR4 students who had been
             to Lodz so that they could enlighten us on our research and explain in more detail the way of life in Lodz.
             They were then able to give us some tips for our Erasmus on many topics. 
             The first thing we talked about was the subject of accommodation. <br>
            The two students told us that there are three kinds of accommodation which are
            - the dormitories which are the cheapest
            - university rooms which are a bit more expensive but offer the comfort of having your own flat
            - classic flats which are a risk in Poland <br>
            As far as food is concerned, they advised us to go to the university restaurant where meals are only 3 euros.<br>
            One of the students advised us to visit the Pietrovska street, which for him is the most beautiful to see.

        <p>Hi! I am an introvert person, so be alone isn't a problem for me, I'm OK with that. 
          I should be the most serious guy of our group (the only one). 
          I planned to have fun and visit a lot during my Erasmus as soon as I will have finish my work, in group or alone. 
          I really want to enjoy my travel by partying, visiting, discovering people and I hope it will be the best experience in my life.
